            <p>The purpose of this website is to provide people with access to information and opportunities to participate in environmental assessments in British Columbia.</p>
            <p>In February 2017, the BC Environmental Assessment Office proudly launched the first phase of a modernized version of its web-based information system: the EAO Project Information and Collaboration System (also known as “EPIC”).</p>
            <p>EPIC has been designed, built and implemented to improve the efficiency and transparency of the provincial environmental assessment process, and to provide citizens and stakeholders with more intuitive access to project data and information.</p>
            <p>It marks a substantial business and process change for all participants and stakeholders in the environmental assessment process, including project proponents, Aboriginal groups, working group members, and the public.</p>
            <p>The Environmental Assessment Office will continue making improvements to EPIC over time, so if you are interested in providing us with feedback about your experience in using this website, please feel encouraged to send us your comments at: <a href="mailto: epicsupport.eao@gov.bc.ca">epicsupport.eao@gov.bc.ca</a>.</p>
